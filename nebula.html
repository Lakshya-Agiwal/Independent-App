            <span style="color: yellow;">A nebula (Latin for 'cloud' or 'fog';[2] pl. nebulae, nebulæ or
                nebulas[3][4][5][6]) is a distinct body of interstellar clouds (which can consist of cosmic dust,
                hydrogen, helium, molecular clouds; possibly as ionized gases). </span>
            <br>Originally, the term was used to describe any diffused astronomical object, including galaxies beyond
            the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the Andromeda Nebula (and spiral
            galaxies in general as "spiral nebulae") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th
            century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others. Edwin Hubble discovered that most nebulae are associated
            with stars and illuminated by starlight. He also helped categorize nebulae based on the type of light
            spectra they produced.[7]

            Around 150 AD, Ptolemy recorded, in books VII–VIII of his Almagest, five stars that appeared nebulous. He
            also noted a region of nebulosity between the constellations Ursa Major and Leo that was not associated with
            any star.[10] The first true nebula, as distinct from a star cluster, was mentioned by the Persian
            astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi, in his Book of Fixed Stars (964).[11] He noted "a little cloud" where the
            Andromeda Galaxy is located.[12] He also cataloged the Omicron Velorum star cluster as a "nebulous star" and
            other nebulous objects, such as Brocchi's Cluster.[11] The supernova that created the Crab Nebula, the SN
            1054, was observed by Arabic and Chinese astronomers in 1054.[13][14]

            In 1610, Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc discovered the Orion Nebula using a telescope. This nebula was also
            observed by Johann Baptist Cysat in 1618. However, the first detailed study of the Orion Nebula was not
            performed until 1659, by Christiaan Huygens, who also believed he was the first person to discover this
            nebulosity.[12]

            In 1715, Edmond Halley published a list of six nebulae.[15] This number steadily increased during the
            century, with Jean-Philippe de Cheseaux compiling a list of 20 (including eight not previously known) in
            1746. From 1751 to 1753, Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille cataloged 42 nebulae from the Cape of Good Hope, most of
            which were previously unknown. Charles Messier then compiled a catalog of 103 "nebulae" (now called Messier
            objects, which included what are now known to be galaxies) by 1781; his interest was detecting comets, and
            these were objects that might be mistaken for them.[16]






            Slipher and Edwin Hubble continued to collect the spectra from many different nebulae, finding 29 that
            showed emission spectra and 33 that had the continuous spectra of star light.[19] In 1922, Hubble announced
            that nearly all nebulae are associated with stars, and their illumination comes from star light. He also
            discovered that the emission spectrum nebulae are nearly always associated with stars having spectral
            classifications of B or hotter (including all O-type main sequence stars), while nebulae with continuous
            spectra appear with cooler stars.[21] Both Hubble and Henry Norris Russell concluded that the nebulae
            surrounding the hotter stars are transformed in some manner.[19] <br>

                <p>There are a variety of formation mechanisms for the different types of nebulae. Some nebulae form
                    from gas that is already in the interstellar medium while others are produced by stars. Examples of
                    the former case are giant molecular clouds, the coldest, densest phase of interstellar gas, which
                    can form by the cooling and condensation of more diffuse gas. Examples of the latter case are
                    planetary nebulae formed from material shed by a star in late stages of its stellar evolution.

                    Star-forming regions are a class of emission nebula associated with giant molecular clouds. These
                    form as a molecular cloud collapses under its own weight, producing stars. Massive stars may form in
                    the center, and their ultraviolet radiation ionizes the surrounding gas, making it visible at
                    optical wavelengths. The region of ionized hydrogen surrounding the massive stars is known as an H
                    II region while the shells of neutral hydrogen surrounding the H II region are known as
                    photodissociation region. Examples of star-forming regions are the Orion Nebula, the Rosette Nebula
                    and the Omega Nebula. Feedback from star-formation, in the form of supernova explosions of massive
                    stars, stellar winds or ultraviolet radiation from massive stars, or outflows from low-mass stars
                    may disrupt the cloud, destroying the nebula after several million years.

                    Other nebulae form as the result of supernova explosions; the death throes of massive, short-lived
                    stars. The materials thrown off from the supernova explosion are then ionized by the energy and the
                    compact object that its core produces. One of the best examples of this is the Crab Nebula, in
                    Taurus. The supernova event was recorded in the year 1054 and is labeled SN 1054. The compact object
                    that was created after the explosion lies in the center of the Crab Nebula and its core is now a
                    neutron star. <br><br></p>

            <br>Most nebulae can be described as diffuse nebulae, which means that they are extended and contain no
            well-defined boundaries.[23] Diffuse nebulae can be divided into emission nebulae, reflection nebulae and
            dark nebulae.


            Reflection nebulae themselves do not emit significant amounts of visible light, but are near stars and
            reflect light from them.[24] Similar nebulae not illuminated by stars do not exhibit visible radiation, but
            may be detected as opaque clouds blocking light from luminous objects behind them; they are called dark
            nebulae.[24]



            Planetary nebulae are the remnants of the final stages of stellar evolution for mid-mass stars(varying in
            size between 0.5-~8 solar masses). Evolved asymptotic giant branch stars expel their outer layers outwards
            due to strong stellar winds, thus forming gaseous shells, while leaving behind the star's core in the form
            of a white dwarf.[24] Radiation from the hot white dwarf excites the expelled gases, producing emission
            nebulae with spectra similar to those of emission nebulae found in star formation regions.[24] They are H II
            regions, because mostly hydrogen is ionized, but planetary are denser and more compact than nebulae found in
            star formation regions.[24]

            Planetary nebulae were given their name by the first astronomical observers who were initially unable to
            distinguish them from planets, and who tended to confuse them with planets, which were of more interest to
            them. Our Sun is expected to spawn a planetary nebula about 12 billion years after its formation.[25]

                    A nebula is a giant cloud of dust and gas, mostly hydrogen and helium, plus other ionized gases, that exists in space.

                <li>
                    Nebulae are always in motion: their clouds constantly mix and churn, in turn creating magnetic fields.

                    The closest known nebula to Earth is called the Helix Nebula, and it is the remains of a dying star, quite possibly one like the Sun. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Helix nebula is approximately 700 light-years away from Earth.

                    Nebulae themselves are not dangerous - they are just gas and dust - but the effects of a new star forming, or supernovas exploding, could be.
