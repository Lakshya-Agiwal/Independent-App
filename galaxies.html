            <span style="color: yellow;">A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants,
                interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter.[</span>
            <br>The word is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally 'milky', a reference to the Milky Way
            galaxy that contains the Solar System. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few hundred million
            (108) stars to giants with one hundred trillion (1014) stars,[3] each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass.

            Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical,[4] spiral, or irregular.[5]
            Many are thought to have supermassive black holes at their centers. The Milky Way's central black hole,
            known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun.[6] As of March 2016, GN-z11 is
            the oldest and most distant galaxy observed. It has a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from
            Earth, and is seen as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang.

            Greek philosopher Democritus (450–370 BCE) proposed that the bright band on the night sky known as the Milky
            Way might consist of distant stars.[20] Aristotle (384–322 BCE), however, believed the Milky Way was caused
            by "the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some stars that were large, numerous and close together" and
            that the "ignition takes place in the upper part of the atmosphere, in the region of the World that is
            continuous with the heavenly motions."[21] Neoplatonist philosopher Olympiodorus the Younger (c. 495–570 CE)
            was critical of this view, arguing that if the Milky Way was sublunary (situated between Earth and the Moon)
            it should appear different at different times and places on Earth, and that it should have parallax, which
            it did not. In his view, the Milky Way was celestial.[22]





            The first project to describe the shape of the Milky Way and the position of the Sun was undertaken by
            William Herschel in 1785 by counting the number of stars in different regions of the sky. He produced a
            diagram of the shape of the galaxy with the Solar System close to the center.[33][34] Using a refined
            approach, Kapteyn in 1920 arrived at the picture of a small (diameter about 15 kiloparsecs) ellipsoid galaxy
            with the Sun close to the center. A different method by Harlow Shapley based on the cataloguing of globular
            clusters led to a radically different picture: a flat disk with diameter approximately 70 kiloparsecs and
            the Sun far from the center.[31] Both analyses failed to take into account the absorption of light by
            interstellar dust present in the galactic plane; but after Robert Julius Trumpler quantified this effect in
            1930 by studying open clusters, the present picture of our host galaxy emerged.[35] <br>

                <p>A few galaxies outside the Milky Way are visible on a dark night to the unaided eye, including the
                    Andromeda Galaxy, Large Magellanic Cloud, the Small Magellanic Cloud, and the Triangulum Galaxy. In
                    the 10th century, Persian astronomer Al-Sufi made the earliest recorded identification of the
                    Andromeda Galaxy, describing it as a "small cloud".[36] In 964, he probably mentioned the Large
                    Magellanic Cloud in his Book of Fixed Stars (referring to "Al Bakr of the southern Arabs",[37] since
                    at a declination of about 70° south it was not visible where he lived); it was not well known to
                    Europeans until Magellan's voyage in the 16th century.[38][37] The Andromeda Galaxy was later
                    independently noted by Simon Marius in 1612.[36] In 1734, philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg in his
                    Principia speculated that there might be galaxies outside our own that were formed into galactic
                    clusters that were minuscule parts of the universe that extended far beyond what we could see. These
                    views "are remarkably close to the present-day views of the cosmos."[39] In 1745, Pierre Louis
                    Maupertuis conjectured that some nebula-like objects were collections of stars with unique
                    properties, including a glow exceeding the light its stars produced on their own, and repeated
                    Johannes Hevelius's view that the bright spots were massive and flattened due to their rotation.[40]
                    In 1750, Thomas Wright correctly speculated that the Milky Way was a flattened disk of stars, and
                    that some of the nebulae visible in the night sky might be separate Milky Ways.[31][41]

                    Galaxy

                    Toward the end of the 18th century, Charles Messier compiled a catalog containing the 109 brightest
                    celestial objects having nebulous appearance. Subsequently, William Herschel assembled a catalog of
                    5,000 nebulae.[31] In 1845, Lord Rosse constructed a new telescope and was able to distinguish
                    between elliptical and spiral nebulae. He also managed to make out individual point sources in some
                    of these nebulae, lending credence to Kant's earlier conjecture.[42] <br><br></p>

            <br>Evidence for the appearance of galaxies very early in the Universe's history was found in 2006, when it
            was discovered that the galaxy IOK-1 has an unusually high redshift of 6.96, corresponding to just 750
            million years after the Big Bang and making it the most distant and earliest-to-form galaxy seen at that
            time.[99] While some scientists have claimed other objects (such as Abell 1835 IR1916) have higher redshifts
            (and therefore are seen in an earlier stage of the universe's evolution), IOK-1's age and composition have
            been more reliably established. In December 2012, astronomers reported that UDFj-39546284 is the most
            distant object known and has a redshift value of 11.9. The object, estimated to have existed around 380
            million years[100] after the Big Bang (which was about 13.8 billion years ago),[101] is about 13.42 billion
            light travel distance years away. The existence of galaxies so soon after the Big Bang suggests that
            protogalaxies must have grown in the so-called "dark ages".[97] As of May 5, 2015, the galaxy EGS-zs8-1 is
            the most distant and earliest galaxy measured, forming 670 million years after the Big Bang. The light from
            EGS-zs8-1 has taken 13 billion years to reach Earth, and is now 30 billion light-years away, because of the
            expansion of the universe during 13 billion years.[102][103][104][105][106]

                    Eighteenth-century philosopher Immanuel Kant was one of the first people to theorize that the Milky Way was not the only galaxy in the universe. Kant coined the term island universe to describe a galaxy.

                    Our galaxy has many nebulae, and astronomers have also discovered them in many other galaxies as

                    Some of the galaxies receding from the Milky Way are ellipsoidal, like footballs. Galaxies can also be thin and flat with tentacle-like arms — just like the Milky Way.

                    Most galaxies have a black hole at the center, and astronomers have found the mass is consistently about 1/1000th the mass of the host galaxy.

                    The Milky Way rotates at about 250 kilometers per second (about 560,000 mph) and completes a full revolution about every 200 million years.

                    Dark matter aside, galaxies are mostly empty space. If the stars within galaxies were shrunk to the size of oranges, they would be separated by 4,800 kilometers (3,000 miles).

                    We know of about 3,000 planetary nebulae in the Milky Way, and most of them are near the center of
                    our galaxy.
