            <span style="color: yellow;">A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that
                nothing — no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light — can escape from it.</span>
            <br>The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form
            a black hole.[3][4] The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has an enormous
            effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features
            according to general relativity.[5] In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects
            no light.[6][7] Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking
            radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This
            temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially
            impossible to observe directly. <br><br>

            Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th
            century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace.[8] In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild found the first modern
            solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole. David Finkelstein, in 1958, first
            published the interpretation of "black hole" as a region of space from which nothing can escape. Black holes
            were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was not until the 1960s that theoretical work showed they
            were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of neutron stars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in
            1967 sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality. The
            first black hole known was Cygnus X-1, identified by several researchers independently in 1971.[9][10]

            Black holes of stellar mass form when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black
            hole has formed, it can grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. Supermassive black holes of millions
            of solar masses (M☉) may form by absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes. There is
            consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centres of most galaxies.

            The presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with
            electromagnetic radiation such as visible light. Any matter that falls onto a black hole can form an
            external accretion disk heated by friction, forming quasars, some of the brightest objects in the universe.
            Stars passing too close to a supermassive black hole can be shredded into streamers that shine very brightly
            before being "swallowed."[11] If other stars are orbiting a black hole, their orbits can determine the black
            hole's mass and location. Such observations can be used to exclude possible alternatives such as neutron
            stars. In this way, astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in binary systems and
            established that the radio source known as Sagittarius A*, at the core of the Milky Way galaxy, contains a
            supermassive black hole of about 4.3 million solar masses.

            On 11 February 2016, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo collaboration announced the first
            direct detection of gravitational waves, representing the first observation of a black hole merger.[12] On
            10 April 2019, the first direct image of a black hole and its vicinity was published, following observations
            made by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) in 2017 of the supermassive black hole in Messier 87's galactic
            centre.[13][14][15] As of 2021, the nearest known body thought to be a black hole is around 1,500
            light-years (460 parsecs) away (see List of nearest black holes). Though only a couple dozen black holes
            have been found so far in the Milky Way, there are thought to be hundreds of millions, most of which are
            solitary and do not cause emission of radiation.[16] Therefore, they would only be detectable by
            gravitational lensing.<br>

                <p>The idea of a body so massive that even light could not escape was briefly proposed by English
                    astronomical pioneer and clergyman John Michell in a letter published in November 1784. Michell's
                    simplistic calculations assumed such a body might have the same density as the Sun, and concluded
                    that one would form when a star's diameter exceeds the Sun's by a factor of 500, and its surface
                    escape velocity exceeds the usual speed of light. Michell referred to these bodies as dark
                    stars.[18] He correctly noted that such supermassive but non-radiating bodies might be detectable
                    through their gravitational effects on nearby visible bodies.[8][19][20] Scholars of the time were
                    initially excited by the proposal that giant but invisible 'dark stars' might be hiding in plain
                    view, but enthusiasm dampened when the wavelike nature of light became apparent in the early
                    nineteenth century,[21] as if light were a wave rather than a particle, it was unclear what, if any,
                    influence gravity would have on escaping light waves.[8][20]

                    Modern physics discredits Michell's notion of a light ray shooting directly from the surface of a
                    supermassive star, being slowed down by the star's gravity, stopping, and then free-falling back to
                    the star's surface.[22] <br><br></p>

            In 1915, Albert Einstein developed his theory of general relativity, having earlier shown that gravity does
            influence light's motion. Only a few months later, Karl Schwarzschild found a solution to the Einstein field
            equations that describes the gravitational field of a point mass and a spherical mass.[23] A few months
            after Schwarzschild, Johannes Droste, a student of Hendrik Lorentz, independently gave the same solution for
            the point mass and wrote more extensively about its properties.[24][25] This solution had a peculiar
            behaviour at what is now called the Schwarzschild radius, where it became singular, meaning that some of the
            terms in the Einstein equations became infinite. The nature of this surface was not quite understood at the
            time. In 1924, Arthur Eddington showed that the singularity disappeared after a change of coordinates (see
            Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates), although it took until 1933 for Georges Lemaître to realize that this
            meant the singularity at the Schwarzschild radius was a non-physical coordinate singularity.[26] Arthur
            Eddington did however comment on the possibility of a star with mass compressed to the Schwarzschild radius
            in a 1926 book, noting that Einstein's theory allows us to rule out overly large densities for visible stars
            like Betelgeuse because "a star of 250 million km radius could not possibly have so high a density as the
            Sun. Firstly, the force of gravitation would be so great that light would be unable to escape from it, the
            rays falling back to the star like a stone to the earth. Secondly, the red shift of the spectral lines would
            be so great that the spectrum would be shifted out of existence. Thirdly, the mass would produce so much
            curvature of the spacetime metric that space would close up around the star, leaving us outside (i.e.,
            nowhere)."[27][28]
