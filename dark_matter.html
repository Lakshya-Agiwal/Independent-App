            <span style="color: yellow;">Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter thought to account for
                approximately 85% of the matter in the universe.</span>
            <br>Dark matter is called "dark" because it does not appear to interact with the electromagnetic field,
            which means it does not absorb, reflect, or emit electromagnetic radiation (like light) and is, therefore,
            difficult to detect. Various astrophysical observations — including gravitational effects which cannot be
            explained by currently accepted theories of gravity unless more matter is present than can be seen — imply
            dark matter's presence. For this reason, most experts think that dark matter is abundant in the universe and
            has had a strong influence on its structure and evolution.[2]
            Because dark matter has not yet been identified, many other hypotheses have emerged aiming to explain the
            observational phenomena that dark matter was conceived to explain. The most common method is to modify
            general relativity. General relativity is well-tested on solar system scales, but its validity on galactic
            or cosmological scales has not been well proven.[163] A suitable modification to general relativity can in
            principle conceivably eliminate the need for dark matter. The best-known theories of this class are MOND and
            its relativistic generalization tensor-vector-scalar gravity (TeVeS),[164] f(R) gravity,[165] negative mass,
            dark fluid,[166][167][168] and entropic gravity.[169] Alternative theories abound.[170][171]

            The primary evidence for dark matter comes from calculations showing that many galaxies would behave quite
            differently if they did not contain a large amount of unseen matter. Some galaxies would not have formed at
            all and others would not move as they currently do.[3] Other lines of evidence include observations in
            gravitational lensing[4] and the cosmic microwave background, along with astronomical observations of the
            observable universe's current structure, the formation and evolution of galaxies, mass location during
            galactic collisions,[5] and the motion of galaxies within galaxy clusters. In the standard Lambda-CDM model
            of cosmology, the total mass-energy content of the universe contains 5% ordinary matter and energy, 27% dark
            matter, and 68% of a form of energy known as dark energy.[6][7][8][9] Thus, dark matter constitutes 85%[a]
            of the total mass, while dark energy and dark matter constitute 95% of the total mass-energy
            content.[10][11][12][13]

            Because no one has directly observed dark matter yet – assuming it exists – it must barely interact with
            ordinary baryonic matter and radiation except through gravity. Most dark matter is thought to be
            non-baryonic; it may be composed of some as-yet-undiscovered subatomic particles.[b] The primary candidate
            for dark matter is some new kind of elementary particle that has not yet been discovered, particularly
            weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs).[14] Many experiments to directly detect and study dark matter
            particles are being actively undertaken, but none have yet succeeded.[15] Dark matter is classified as
            "cold," "warm," or "hot" according to its velocity (more precisely, its free streaming length). Current
            models favor a cold dark matter scenario, in which structures emerge by the gradual accumulation of
            particles. <br>

                <p>The hypothesis of dark matter has an elaborate history.[17] In a talk given in 1884,[18] Lord Kelvin
                    estimated the number of dark bodies in the Milky Way from the observed velocity dispersion of the
                    stars orbiting around the center of the galaxy. By using these measurements, he estimated the mass
                    of the galaxy, which he determined is different from the mass of visible stars. Lord Kelvin thus
                    concluded "many of our stars, perhaps a great majority of them, may be dark bodies".[19][20] In
                    1906, Henri Poincaré in "The Milky Way and Theory of Gases" used the French term matière obscure
                    ("dark matter") in discussing Kelvin's work.[21][20]


                    In 1933, Swiss astrophysicist Fritz Zwicky, who studied galaxy clusters while working at the
                    California Institute of Technology, made a similar inference.[28][29] Zwicky applied the virial
                    theorem to the Coma Cluster and obtained evidence of unseen mass he called Dunkle Materie ('dark
                    matter'). Zwicky estimated its mass based on the motions of galaxies near its edge and compared that
                    to an estimate based on its brightness and number of galaxies. He estimated the cluster had about
                    400 times more mass than was visually observable. The gravity effect of the visible galaxies was far
                    too small for such fast orbits, thus mass must be hidden from view. Based on these conclusions,
                    Zwicky inferred some unseen matter provided the mass and associated gravitation attraction to hold
                    the cluster together.[30] Zwicky's estimates were off by more than an order of magnitude, mainly due
                    to an obsolete value of the Hubble constant;[31] the same calculation today shows a smaller
                    fraction, using greater values for luminous mass. Nonetheless, Zwicky did correctly conclude from
                    his calculation that the bulk of the matter was dark.[20]

            At the same time Rubin and Ford were exploring optical rotation curves, radio astronomers were making use of
            new radio telescopes to map the 21 cm line of atomic hydrogen in nearby galaxies. The radial distribution of
            interstellar atomic hydrogen (H-I) often extends to much larger galactic radii than those accessible by
            optical studies, extending the sampling of rotation curves – and thus of the total mass distribution – to a
            new dynamical regime. Early mapping of Andromeda with the 300 foot telescope at Green Bank[41] and the 250
            foot dish at Jodrell Bank[42] already showed the H-I rotation curve did not trace the expected Keplerian
            decline. As more sensitive receivers became available, Morton Roberts and Robert Whitehurst[43] were able to
            trace the rotational velocity of Andromeda to 30 kpc, much beyond the optical measurements. Illustrating the
            advantage of tracing the gas disk at large radii, Figure 16 of that paper[43] combines the optical data[37]
            (the cluster of points at radii of less than 15 kpc with a single point further out) with the H-I data
            between 20–30 kpc, exhibiting the flatness of the outer galaxy rotation curve; the solid curve peaking at
            the center is the optical surface density, while the other curve shows the cumulative mass, still rising
            linearly at the outermost measurement. In parallel, the use of interferometric arrays for extragalactic H-I
            spectroscopy was being developed. In 1972, David Rogstad and Seth Shostak[44] published H-I rotation curves
            of five spirals mapped with the Owens Valley interferometer; the rotation curves of all five were very flat,
            suggesting very large values of mass-to-light ratio in the outer parts of their extended H-I disks.

                    Dark matter is not simply normal matter that we cannot detect.

                    Our galaxy has many nebulae, and astronomers have also discovered them in many other galaxies as
                    well.

                <li>
                    Dark matter must be cold in nature
                <li>
                    Some of the galaxies receding from the Milky Way are ellipsoidal, like footballs. Galaxies can also
                    be thin and flat with tentacle-like arms — just like the Milky Way.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dark matter must not interact very much with itself, with light, or with normal matter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Most galaxies have a black hole at the center, and astronomers have found the mass is consistently
                    about 1/1000th the mass of the host galaxy.

                <li>
                    Dark matter's effects are most dominant, on average, in the smallest galaxies of all.
                <li>
                    One galactic revolution ago, dinosaurs ruled the Earth.

                <li>
                    Dark matter aside, galaxies are mostly empty space. If the stars within galaxies were shrunk to the
                    size of oranges, they would be separated by 4,800 kilometers (3,000 miles).

                    Dark matter causes gravitational effects in places where normal matter isn't located.
