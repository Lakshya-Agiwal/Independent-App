            <span style="color: yellow;">A star is an astronomical object comprising a luminous spheroid of plasma held
                together by its gravity.</span>
            <br>The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night, but their
            immense distance from Earth makes them appear as fixed points of light in the sky. The most prominent stars
            have been categorised into constellations and asterisms, and many of the brightest stars have proper names.
            Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar
            designations. The observable universe contains an estimated 1022 to 1024 stars. Still, most are invisible to
            the naked eye from Earth, including all individual stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way.

            Early astronomers recognized a difference between "fixed stars", whose position on the celestial sphere does
            not change, and "wandering stars" (planets), which move noticeably relative to the fixed stars over days or
            weeks.[4] Many ancient astronomers believed that the stars were permanently affixed to a heavenly sphere and
            that they were immutable. By convention, astronomers grouped prominent stars into asterisms and
            constellations and used them to track the motions of the planets and the inferred position of the Sun.[2]
            The motion of the Sun against the background stars (and the horizon) was used to create calendars, which
            could be used to regulate agricultural practices.[5] The Gregorian calendar, currently used nearly
            everywhere in the world, is a solar calendar based on the angle of the Earth's rotational axis relative to
            its local star, the Sun.






            Medieval Islamic astronomers gave Arabic names to many stars that are still used today and they invented
            numerous astronomical instruments that could compute the positions of the stars. They built the first large
            observatory research institutes, mainly for the purpose of producing Zij star catalogues.[17] Among these,
            the Book of Fixed Stars (964) was written by the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi, who observed a
            number of stars, star clusters (including the Omicron Velorum and Brocchi's Clusters) and galaxies
            (including the Andromeda Galaxy).[18] According to A. Zahoor, in the 11th century, the Persian polymath
            scholar Abu Rayhan Biruni described the Milky Way galaxy as a multitude of fragments having the properties
            of nebulous stars, and gave the latitudes of various stars during a lunar eclipse in 1019.[19]



            The Italian astronomer Geminiano Montanari recorded observing variations in luminosity of the star Algol in
            1667. Edmond Halley published the first measurements of the proper motion of a pair of nearby "fixed" stars,
            demonstrating that they had changed positions since the time of the ancient Greek astronomers Ptolemy and
            Hipparchus.[21] <br>

                <p>The concept of a constellation was known to exist during the Babylonian period. Ancient sky watchers
                    imagined that prominent arrangements of stars formed patterns, and they associated these with
                    particular aspects of nature or their myths. Twelve of these formations lay along the band of the
                    ecliptic and these became the basis of astrology.[41] Many of the more prominent individual stars
                    were given names, particularly with Arabic or Latin designations.

                    As well as certain constellations and the Sun itself, individual stars have their own myths.[42] To
                    the Ancient Greeks, some "stars", known as planets (Greek πλανήτης (planētēs), meaning "wanderer"),
                    represented various important deities, from which the names of the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars,
                    Jupiter and Saturn were taken.[42] (Uranus and Neptune were Greek and Roman gods, but neither planet
                    was known in Antiquity because of their low brightness. Their names were assigned by later
                    astronomers.)

                    Circa 1600, the names of the constellations were used to name the stars in the corresponding regions
                    of the sky. The German astronomer Johann Bayer created a series of star maps and applied Greek
                    letters as designations to the stars in each constellation. Later a numbering system based on the
                    star's right ascension was invented and added to John Flamsteed's star catalogue in his book
                    "Historia coelestis Britannica" (the 1712 edition), whereby this numbering system came to be called
                    Flamsteed designation or Flamsteed numbering.[43][44] <br><br></p>

            <br>The formation of a star begins with gravitational instability within a molecular cloud, caused by
            regions of higher density—often triggered by compression of clouds by radiation from massive stars,
            expanding bubbles in the interstellar medium, the collision of different molecular clouds, or the collision
            of galaxies (as in a starburst galaxy).[59][60] When a region reaches a sufficient density of matter to
            satisfy the criteria for Jeans instability, it begins to collapse under its own gravitational force.[61]

            As the cloud collapses, individual conglomerations of dense dust and gas form "Bok globules". As a globule
            collapses and the density increases, the gravitational energy converts into heat and the temperature rises.
            When the protostellar cloud has approximately reached the stable condition of hydrostatic equilibrium, a
            protostar forms at the core.[62] These pre-main-sequence stars are often surrounded by a protoplanetary disk
            and powered mainly by the conversion of gravitational energy. The period of gravitational contraction lasts
            about 10 million years for a star like the sun, up to 100 million years for a red dwarf.[63]

            Early stars of less than 2 M☉ are called T Tauri stars, while those with greater mass are Herbig Ae/Be
            stars. These newly formed stars emit jets of gas along their axis of rotation, which may reduce the angular
            momentum of the collapsing star and result in small patches of nebulosity known as Herbig–Haro
            objects.[64][65] These jets, in combination with radiation from nearby massive stars, may help to drive away
            the surrounding cloud from which the star was formed.[66]
